its here,,bitto's zoom event for codename...

Right now, this contains 5 events:
- **Zoom Tween:** Lets you zoom in and out with every ease, along with lerping and instant zooms. Simple and effective. You can even reset to stage zoom easily!
- **Cinematic Bars:** Lets you move simple cinematic bars around. same tweens as Zoom, and you can even choose between it going below or above the HUD.
- **Angle Tween:** The same as Zoom Tween, but for the camera angle. lerp uses the camera speed. 
- **Better Alt Switches:** Not really much to explain. Its the same as the regular alt switches event, but it lets you set the idle and sing suffixes separately, and to more than just "-alt".
- **(bonus) get snappy**: Multiplicative camera speed controller. Lets you make it instant, too.
