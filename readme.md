# Bitto's Codename Collection
A collection of events made for Codename Engine.

## Contents
Right now, this contains 5 main events:
- **Zoom Tween:** Lets you zoom in and out with every ease, along with lerping and instant zooms. Simple and effective. You can even reset to stage zoom easily!
- **Cinematic Bars:** Lets you move simple cinematic bars around. same tweens as Zoom, and you can even choose between it going below or above the HUD.
- **Angle Tween:** The same as Zoom Tween, but for the camera angle. lerp uses the camera speed.
- **Better Alt Switches:** Not really much to explain. Its the same as the regular alt switches event, but it lets you set the idle and sing suffixes separately, and to more than just "-alt".
- **Duet Cam** Allows you to move the camera between two strums, and even pick which characters in those strums are accounted.

And a bonus one:
- **get snappy**: Multiplicative camera speed controller. Lets you make it instant, too.

## How to download
To get every event, use the **"Download Zip"** in the **"Code"** dropdown (the big green button). This also downloads the old versions though, so you'd have to delete that folder.
You can also get events individually by clicking on them and using the **"Download raw file"** button. More Tedious, but it lets you cherry-pick which events you want.
